1)Program files: main.cpp

	There is only 1 program file.

2)My sample5.txt counts down from 9 to 0 and then prints GOBLIN. It intersperses exclamation marks whenever a timer interrupt occurs.

3)Compile Instructions: 
	The program was compiled on cslinux1.utdallas.edu using a special command that enables C++11.

	I am unsure if it is necessary for the program to run, but I have only ever compiled it using these commands on the terminal:

		 alias g++='g++610 -std=c++11'
 		export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/gcc610/lib64
 		g++ -o proj1 main.cpp

	To be safe, these commands should be used to compile my program.
